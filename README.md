# Anomalies in Time Series (ATS)

This repository provides a modular framework with clean, well-defined interfaces for time series anomaly detection. It includes both classical methods and novel example implementations, making it easy to experiment with, extend, and compare approaches.

Each model has well-defined `capabilites`, following a specific [taxonomy](TAXONOMY.md) which allows to clearly state what models can and cannot do, from an operational standpoint. For example:

```
>>> LSTMAnomalyDetector.capabilities
{
  "training": {
    "mode": "semi-supervised",
    "update": False
  },
  "inference": {
    "streaming": true,
    "dependency": "window",
    "granularity": "point-labels"
  },
  "data": {
    "dimensionality": ["univariate-single",
                       "multivariate-single"],
    "sampling": "regular"
  }
}
```

It also offers a synthetic data generator for testing purposes, and an evaluator focusing more on model strengths and weaknesses rather than absolute performance.

Example notebooks are provided as well, and can be found in the root of the repository.
